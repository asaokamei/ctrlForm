formUpDown
==========

a JavaScript to navigate through html form using ctrol+arrow keys.

In side a table style form (as often found in phpMyAdmin), this 
script lets you navigate element to element freely inside the 
table like an Excel; goint left/right and up/down. 

requires jQuery and its plugin, hotkeys. 

To-Dos
------

still buggy. 
don't know what is causing this yet. 

in Mac OSX, ctrl+arrow keys are used by Mission Control. 
should bind to command+arrow keys. 

should provide as jQuery's plugin module.
