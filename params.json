Well, at least \r\nit should since I have not tested yet with any other forms. \r\n\r\nrequires jQuery and its plugin, hotkeys. \r\n\r\nHow to Use ctrlForm\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\ninclude jQuery, hotkeys, and ctrlForm, and initiate ctrlForm \r\nspecifying which form to control. \r\n\r\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"./vendor/jquery-1.7.1.js\"></script>\r\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"./vendor/jquery.hotkeys.js\"></script>\r\n    <SCRIPT type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"./ctrlForm.js\"></script>\r\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n    $(document).ready(function() {\r\n      $('form').ctrlForm( {\r\n        focus: 3,\r\n        control: 'ctrl',\r\n        onEnter: true\r\n      } );\r\n    });\r\n    </script>\r\n\r\nOptions are:\r\n\r\n* `$('form').ctrlForm( {focus:3} );` \r\n\r\n    focus on 3rd elemnt in the form. default is 0.\r\n\r\n* `$('form').ctrlForm( {control:'ctrl'} );` \r\n\r\n    use ctrl key only to control the form. \r\n    default is ['ctrl','meta'].\r\n\r\n* `$('form').ctrlForm( {onEnter:true} );` \r\n\r\n    enter key acts as ctrl+left, except for textarea, submit, and reset buttons.\r\n    default is false.\r\n\r\n\r\nTable Structure\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThis scripts judges if an element is inside a table by checking \r\nif the name contains '[' charactor. example: `email[3]`. The \r\nbody of the name (without [) is considered as its name of the element. \r\n\r\nif a focused element has [ charctor in its name, ctrlUDForm tries to \r\nfind a next element with name having the same name, i.e. `email[4]`.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, ctrlUDForm does not check the value of index nor table \r\nstructure, and therefore it may not work well for certain case...","tagline":"uses up/down keys to navigate through html form.
